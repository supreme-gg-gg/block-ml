## Dev Resources

[I should have started with these beginner intuitive helpful tutorials!][1]

[The documentation is a bit too dense lol][2]

[Why do I feel like we are bulding a GUI for Keras lmao][3]

[Sisyphus would have reached the top by the time we got to implement these COOL plugins!][4]

## Environment setup

**You would not be able to run anything without first enabling npm and dependent modules**

```
npm install
node server.js
npx webpack
```

- `npm install` downloads all the node_modules specified as dependencies in `package.json`
- During development the files are put under src/ for webpack to generate bundle.js in the public directory served by node.js
- You can make webpack recompile bundle.js automatically when a change is detected in the src/ folder using `npx webpack --watch`
- Nodemon can automatically restart the node.js server when changes are made to server-side files like server.js: `npx nodemon server.js`

## Script Execution

> The following method has been proved to work!

For now, the only way to execute the generate script (recommended) is through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). Since it only accepts Jupyter Notebook, from the root directory run `python3 convert.py` to generate `generatedNotebook.ipynb` in build/. Then, upload this file to Colab together with other data file you specified in the input path.
