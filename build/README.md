# Description

The block-ml/build folder contains generated code by the program, usually python scripts, but it may also contain other accessories used in the entire design, train, deployment process such as saved model files.

For long term deployment, cloud computing platforms generally work better with python scripts and it is also more scalable. However, for simplicity we convert it to a Jupyter Notebook for now so that it can easily be executed on Colab. Please run `python3 convert.py` from the ROOT directory.
